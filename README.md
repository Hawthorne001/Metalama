Welcome to Metalama, a cutting-edge Roslyn-based meta-programming framework designed to enhance your code quality and productivity in C#. Metalama stands on three foundational principles:

* *Boilerplate Reduction*: Harness the power of aspect-oriented programming to dynamically generate repetitive code during compilation. This ensures your source code stays concise and clear.
* *Architecture as Code*: Receive real-time validation of your code against your architectural guidelines, patterns, and conventions. Say goodbye to waiting for code reviews.
* *Tailored Coding Assistance*: Arm your team with personalized code fixes and refactorings.

## The Dream Weavers of Metalama

It's in the vibrant streets of Prague, Czechia, that an insurrection against boilerplate took rose in 2004. Back in the days when the C# compiler was an obscure, closed-source monolith, inaccessible for extensibility, our first product PostSharp became the first successful implementation of aspect-oriented in .NET. Fifteen years later, when Microsoft released .NET 5 and added source generators to Roslyn, we knew it was time for a complete rewrite based on new .NET stack. This project, originally codenamed "Caravela", became Metalama.
